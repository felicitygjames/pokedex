# pokedex

This project was my first experience working with an API. 

This pokedex app connects to the pokedex API (https://pokeapi.co/) and using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, data from the API is displayed in a user-friendly format.

I took data from the API including pokemon names, heights and abilities and made them into a styled directory in this app.
